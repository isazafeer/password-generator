**Password Generator**

In this week's challenge, I have been tasked with programming a password generator using Javascript.

Initially, I was given a starter code to work on and develop, and the image above was the final result.

The functionality of the website is exceptional as everything operates as intended. For example, if the user does not enter the a specific value for their password in the initial, another pop-up asks them to input the value again.

If a user incorrectly inputs a value, they are asked to repeat it with the correct value. If they would like a password only containing special and uppercase characters, the generator is able to accomodate for this.

One obstacle that I encountered during this challenge was creating loops, and breaking them once their purpose was fulfilled. Through independant research, I was able to overcome this and complete this project.

Overall, this project is operational, and performs as intended. It is user friendly and ensures that the password generated are the preferences of the user.
